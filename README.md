# Student Notes REST Backend

This repository is to be used as the backend for [Student Note React Frontend](https://github.com/connormcwood/student-react-frontend) which combined will allow notes to be created and manipulated. This project is purely a personal project to keep up to date with common technologies. This project is intended to be able to be swapped out with a node project that offers the same functionality as the backend.
